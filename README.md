# Introduction to Python

## What did i learn

## learning a new languages 

- how is different is the syntax

## Python syntax (difference in 

### Variable declaration

```
answer = get_string("What's your name? ")

```

Don't need to specify the type 
you don't need to use ;

### print

We can also write: with a format string
```
print("hello, " + answer)
print(f"hello, {answer}"
```
diferences:
- we can concatenate two string together with +
- you don't /n because we get it for free if print

### incremention

- there is no ++ in python
- so you have to use <code>counter += 1</code>


## Conditionals

```
Conditionals look like:

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")

```

differences:

- no {} or ()
